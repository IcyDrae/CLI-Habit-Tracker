* Getting Started
This software is built in self contained form and distributed as an executable. .NET is not required to run it. You should just pick the download for your system and run the executable file from the terminal.

Supported systems:

- linux-x64
- osx-x64
- win-x64

* Installing
Register the executable in your path or create a symlink or an alias, and you can use the app.

On the first run the app will create a JSON file called /HabitTracker.json/ on the user's desktop. This file will be used to manage the habits.

* How/where to download
Over at the [[./bin/Release/net8.0/]] directory.

* Any modifications needed to be made to files/folders

#+end_src
